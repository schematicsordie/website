# Schematics ðŸª›

## Product Standards

Electronics are required to come with schematics, just like prepared food
has nutrition facts on the package. Similar to checking whether you can digest
well what you eat, schematics allow you to make an informed decision based on
longevity to be expected. Likewise, you can ask others to help you out, such
as your nearby repair technician, makerspace, or good friend with experience.
